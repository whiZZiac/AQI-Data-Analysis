# Air Quality Analysis in India (2015-2020)

### Project Summary
This project is an analysis of air quality data in India from 2015 to 2020, with the objective of predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) values using various machine learning models. The analysis process includes data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation. The final model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting AQI levels.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project, "Air Quality Data in India (2015-2020)," can be downloaded from Kaggle:  
[Air Quality Data in India (2015-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)

### Project Contents
- `air_quality_analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, from data processing and modeling to evaluation.

### Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, and `tensorflow` (for LSTM model, if included)

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the same directory as the notebook (or update paths as necessary).
3. Open `air_quality_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell in sequence to see the full analysis and final model evaluation.

### Results
The final model achieved:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** [your MSE result here]
- **R² Score:** [your R² result here]

These results indicate strong model performance in accurately predicting AQI.
